The last computation has made Jack a little worried about the safety of his hash, and after doing some more research it seems there's a bigger problem.

Given no other data of the JACK11 hash algorithm, how many unique secrets would you expect to hash to have (on average) a 75% chance of a collision between two distinct secrets?

Remember, given any input data, JACK11 has been designed to produce a deterministic bit array of length 11, which is sensitive to small changes using the avalanche effect.
