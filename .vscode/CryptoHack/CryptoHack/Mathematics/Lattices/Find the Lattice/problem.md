As we've seen, lattices contain hard problems which can form trapdoor functions for cryptosystems. We also find that in cryptanalysis, lattices can break cryptographic protocols which seem at first to be unrelated to lattices.

This challenge uses modular arithmetic to encrypt the flag, but hidden within the protocol is a two-dimensional lattice. We highly recommend spending time with this challenge and finding how you can break it with a lattice. This is a famous example with plenty of resources available, but knowing how to spot the lattice within a system is often the key to breaking it.

As a hint, you will be able to break this challenge using the Gaussian reduction from the previous challenge.
